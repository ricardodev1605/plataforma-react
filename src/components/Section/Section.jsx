            <p>
                When I was younger I saw my daddy cry <br />
                And curse at the wind<br />
                He broke his own heart and I watched<br />
                As he tried to reassemble it<br />
                <br/>
                And my momma swore that she would<br />
                Never let herself forget<br />
                And that was the day that I promised<br />
                I'd never sing of love if it does not exist<br />
            </p>

                All I wanted was you<br />
                <br />
                I think I'll pace my apartment a few times<br />
                And fall asleep on the couch<br />
                And wake up early to black and white reruns<br />
                That escaped from my mouth<br />
                Oh, oh
            </p>

            <p>
            So I crave, crave<br />
            To do it again, all again<br />
            Crave, crave to do it again, ah<br />
            Just for a second, it all felt simple<br />
            I'm already missing it<br />
            So I crave, crave to do it again<br />
            All again<br />
            </p>
        </div>
